# KOBCC

## Abstract
KochiOrgBook Community Cloud is a cloud interface for the city of Kochi. The Community Cloud project aims to develop a platform where participants can build, host and operate their own blockchain applications and related functions on the blockchain.
## Dependent Projects

The project is dependent on KOBman.

## Motivation

Decentralized Identifier or DIDs refer to a system in which there is no common storage facility available. There might be many users who cannot setup and maintain DIDs themselves. There can also be many organizations/associations who do not have the infrastructre and other facilities for hosting nodes.    
## Status of the project:

KOBCC will move into incubation, if approved.

## Solution
A cloud platform providing various services to the user can be made, which consists of services including generation of DIDs, updating DIDs and verification of them. Each of nodes once hosted can be made into a cluster with the help of Kunernetes or Raspberry Pi. The cloud is accessible only to the needy ones and remains inaccessible to normal users who have the setup to host nodes. It can be considered something similar to GoDaddy website where we can get domains ending with .com at low costs.
