# KOBCC

## Abstract
KochiOrgBook Community Cloud is a provision given to an entity who does not have an infrastructure to build, host and run their nodes. Here, the entity can be an association like an association of lawyers, an association of doctors or it can be citizens who are trying to present their proof. It can be considered as a pool of infrastructure components on which their nodes can be implemented. The major stakeholders of the project include the citizens of Kochi, the associations who are to be onboarded and the various service providers.

## Dependent Projects

The project is dependent on KOBman.

## Motivation

Decentralized Identifier or DIDs refer to a system in which there is no common storage facility available. There might be many users who cannot setup and maintain DIDs themselves. There can also be many organizations/associations who do not have the infrastructre and other facilities for hosting nodes.    
## Status of the project:

KOBCC will move into incubation, if approved.

## Solution
A cloud platform providing various services to the users, which consists of services including generation of DIDs, updating DIDs and verification of them. For experimentation purpose, a test network will be build first using Raspberry Pi and each of nodes once hosted can be made into a cluster with the help of Raspberry Pi. The cloud is accessible only to the needy ones and remains inaccessible to normal users who have the setup to host the nodes. It can be considered something similar to GoDaddy website where we can get domains ending with .com at low costs. Once the project is ready, each of the data will be stored in a verifiable credential registry.
